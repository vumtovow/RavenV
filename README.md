# Raven V

### Raven V isn't just another Raven build with 2 new modules... 
V fully re-writes many of Raven's core architectures and adds a translation layer which allows for kotlin based LiquidBounce modules to be run as if they were Raven modules.

### Full UI Overhaul.
All around improvements have been made to the UI make it more modern and easier on the eyes. Before it looked like outdated and low effort.


## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```



### Disclaimer: Large amounts of code is taken directly from Liquid Bounce, this client is open source and not being created for profit. If this client ever goes closed source it will not be sold or distributed and vum is not responsible for the actions of anyone that does so.
