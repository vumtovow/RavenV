# Raven V

### Raven V isn't just another Raven build with 2 new modules... 
V fully re-writes many of Raven's core architectures and adds a translation layer which allows for kotlin based liquidbounce modules to be run as if they were Raven modules.

### Full UI Overhaul.
All around improvements have been made to the UI make it more modern and easier on the eyes. Before it looked like outdated and low effort.


## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```
